<h1>Foreword </h1>
<p>

This comic was created to explore how users interact with CleverCogs software in Blackwood homes. Our main aim is to show associations between the content accessed by CleverCogs users, and traits such as their age, gender or condition/disability. 

Agnes, the protagonist of our story, is a typical user of CleverCogs, designed 
 by combining the most common traits of the users. We created Agnes because as we analysed the data, we realised it told us a lot about the usersâ€™ lifestyle - when they wake and sleep, how they spend their time, even their favourite football teams. Agnes acts as a narrator, and also an indicator of how users may feel about CleverCogs and how it may improve their lives.
